- Expo CLI (`npm install -g expo-cli`)

### Backend Setup

1. Clone the repository
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/zen-cure.git
   cd zen-cure
   ```

2. Set up environment variables
   ```
   cd server
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

3. Edit the `.env` file with your configuration:
   ```
   PORT=5000
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/zencure
   JWT_SECRET=your_secure_secret_key
   NODE_ENV=development
   ```

4. Install dependencies
   ```
   npm install
   ```

5. Create an admin user
   ```
   npm run create-admin
   ```

6. Seed the database with initial remedies
   ```
   npm run seed
   ```

7. Start the development server
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory
   ```
   cd ../front
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file for API configuration
   ```
   API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
   ```

3. Install dependencies
   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the Expo development server
   ```
   npm start
   ```

5. Use Expo Go app on your device to scan the QR code, or run in a simulator/emulator

## üì± App Workflow

## üîç Core Algorithm

The heart of ZenCure is its remedy querying algorithm, which calculates relevance scores based on:

1. **Symptom Matching**: How well the remedy addresses the queried symptoms
2. **Source Credibility**: Quality of scientific evidence supporting the remedy
3. **User Ratings**: Community feedback on effectiveness
4. **Recency**: Prioritizes newer and updated information

```typescript
// Simplified version of the algorithm
const scoredRemedies = matchingRemedies.map(remedy => {
  // Base score from average rating (0-50 points)
  let relevanceScore = remedy.avgRating * 10;
  
  // Add points for matching symptoms (0-10 points per symptom)
  remedy.symptoms.forEach(symptom => {
    if (keywords.includes(symptom.name)) {
      relevanceScore += symptom.relevanceScore / 10;
    }
  });
  
  // Add points for source credibility (0-20 points)
  const avgCredibility = getAverageCredibility(remedy.sourceIds);
  relevanceScore += avgCredibility * 2;
  
  // Add points for recency (0-10 points)
  const ageInDays = calculateAgeInDays(remedy.createdAt);
  const recencyScore = Math.max(0, 10 - (ageInDays / 30));
  relevanceScore += recencyScore;
  
  return {
    ...remedy,
    calculatedRelevanceScore: relevanceScore
  };
});
```
